    This needs to be broken out into the MIPO functions (main, input, processing, outputs). (Sorry.)

-------------------------

Calin:
    I can assure you, now, that all my functions meet MIPO requirements.
     `main` is,  ov course,  my [M]ain function, `sum` is a built-in
     function which acts as my [P]rocessing function, `print_rainfalldata`
     is my [O]utput function, and every function with "get" and "input",
     just about, are my [I]nput functions.

	    Done! â€” I even gave you one ov them fancy screen clearin'
