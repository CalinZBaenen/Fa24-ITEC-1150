    This needs to be broken out into the MIPO functions (main, input, processing, outputs).
    You obviously know how to use functions, but I have to have some consistency with my grading (yes, "A foolish 
    consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds...", but it's more the expectation of others than my own need for 
    consistency :-) )

    I thought I had (enough). â€” Hopefully making the `print_range_and_sum`
     function was solution!

	    See the general requirements slides for the labs; starting with Chapter 3, unless the lab specifically exempts
	    the requirement, programs must offer to restart.
	
	-------------------------
	
	Calin:
	    Did I do it correctly?
	    I assume what you meant by "offer to restart" is "allow the user to
	     use the functionality ov the program without opening it again".

Erik:
    This is obviously really well-written, but make sure to hit the requirements before jumping into the fun stuff!
