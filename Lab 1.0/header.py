Description:  First assignment

I'm taking this course because, while I already have experience in
 programming, I want to get credentials in the field, so I can get into
 high(er)-paying jobs.

   Hi, Calin. This how you'll see my feedback and comments in your lab submissions this semester. I'll often leave 
   multiple comments through your program, so be sure to scan through the whole thing. If this were a graded assignment,
   you'd also see a point deduction following my name because you forgot to include the print statement :-)

   Welcome to class! Feel free to schedule time with me or come to office hours for any questions related to class or a 
   career as a developer.
